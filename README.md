        <h1>My name is Glenya</h1>
        <p> I'm a senior at North Johnston High School. I'm currently a part of the yearbook, which I really like doing. This is because there are so many chances presented by it, like the chance to meet new people, take images, learn about marketing and advertising, and much more. I sincerely hope that I will be able to use the new abilities I'm picking up for the yearbook to edit some movies and produce highlights of school-related events.</p>
